REQUIRED MODULES

Math::BigInt
NetPacket + additional IPv6.pm


NOTE ABOUT IPv6.pm

As NetPacket::IP is not supporting IPv6 I released a modified IP.pm 
(called IPv6.pm) which includes IPv6 decoding. The file is located in 
lib/NetPacket/IPv6.pm and will be copied during the installation.
In case of problems you can also download the file here:
