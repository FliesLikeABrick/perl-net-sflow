INSTALL

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install


REQUIRED MODULES

Math::BigInt
Net::IP
NetPacket


IMPORTANT NOTE

As NetPacket::IP is not supporting IPv6 I released a modified IP.pm which 
includes IPv6 decoding. In order to use sFlow.pm with IPv6 support you have 
to overwrite the original NetPacket IP.pm with the new version which is 
available here: http://jasinska.de/sFlow/NetPacket::IP/
IF YOU DON'T DO THAT sFlow.pm WILL SKIP EVERY IPv6 SAMPLE!!!
